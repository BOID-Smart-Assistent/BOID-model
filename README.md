# BOID-model

## Python installation

To use this model with Python, you have to add it as a dependency through Pip.
This can be achieved by using a `venv` and a `requirements.txt`.

First create a `requirements.txt` with the following steps:
1. `pip install pipreqs`
2. `pipreqs .`

Then add the following line to the `requirements.txt`:
```boid-model @ git+ssh://git@github.com/BOID-Smart-Assistent/BOID-model.git#<TAG>```

You have to change the `<TAG>` part to the latest tag version of the repository.

Now you can install the model `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To use the classes generated by protobuf, you have to import it like

```from model.boid import <message>```

Now you can use the protobuf classes in your program.

## Javascript installation

Add the following line to your `package.json`
```"BOID-model": "git+ssh://git@github.com/BOID-Smart-Assistent/BOID-model.git#v0.0.6"```
